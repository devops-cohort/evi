	<p>The Eurovision Song Contest is an international song competition, among countries mainly in European Broadcast Union (EBU). Initially the competition was called “The Eurovision Grand Prix”, and it was inspired by the famous Italian Festival, San Remo.</p>
 <p>“At the beginning of the television age in the early 1950’s, the European television landscape offered the image of a political divided and technical fragmented continent” (Esc-history.com, 2019). At the same time, EBU was looking for a way to reunite the European Countries after the disruption of World War II. In 1955, Marcel Bezençon, came up with the idea of the Eurovision Song Contests. Back then, it was a technologically challenging project, to join that many countries together in a wide area international network.
 The first Eurovision Song Contest was held in Lugano, Switzerland in 1953 and with only 7 participants. “With a live orchestra, the norm in the early years, and simple sing-along songs on every radio station, the Contest grew into a true pan-European tradition” (Eurovision.tv, 2019). The contest grown through the years, nowadays more than 40 countries are participating every year. Also, non- European countries like Israel and in recent years Australia are also participating.</p>
 <p>Eurovision Song Contest was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Record as the Longest Running Annual TV Music Competition in 2015. During the last 62 years more than 1500 songs was produced from more than 50 countries, including countries that do not exist anymore (e.g. Yugoslavia).
Every year each participating country submit one original song and performs it on a live television and radio. Then each country is televoting the favourite song and the winning country would host the contest the next year. Throughout the years many changes have happened on the voting system. In earlier years, only juries could vote and there was no televoting from the public but now its 50/50 between juries and telephone votes. Moreover, due the growing number of the participation demand, semi-finals were introduced in 2007. Beside changes in voting system, changes happened and for the presentations of the votes. Ever since 1994, each country announces their results by having their spokesperson standing in front of a famous landmark of their country. Currently the voting and presentation system works like this: The viewers can vote by telephone or by the official mobile app. Each national spokesperson will announce the results of their professional jury in the usual way by giving points 1-8, 10 and 12 to their favourites. Then the televoting points from each country will be combined and announce by the host starting by the country that received the less points from the public and ending with the country that received the most points. Therefore, the winner will be announced at the very end of the show.
